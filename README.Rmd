The {mldesign} package allows meaningful data splitting for supervised machine learning tasks. 
The data splitting in {mldesign} is based on an **estimand** definition which is in turn based
on user-specified constraints.

**Constraints** can be thought of as generalized inclusion/exclusion criteria for 

1. Test observations
2. The relation between observations in train and test set
3. The training dataset(s)

In contrast to traditional techniques (hold-out, cross-validation, bootstrap), this leads to a
deterministic data splitting.

## Installation

You can install the development version of mldesign from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("maxwestphal/mldesign")
```

## Getting started

An overview over important functions and classes and a minimal example can be found in the "overview" vignette:

```{r vignette, eval=FALSE}
library(mldesign)
vignette("overview", "mldesign")
```


## Roadmap

Planned features include:

1. Vast extension of traditional (random) data splitting methods 
2. Nested data splits
3. Export of data splitting to popular ML packages
3. print/summary/visualize functions for derived splits
